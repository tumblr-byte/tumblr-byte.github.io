        <h2>Person Detection & Tracking</h2>
        <video src="person.mp4" controls muted></video>
        <p>
    This project uses computer vision and AI to automatically detect people in a video stream and track their movement in real time. 
    It can identify when and where people enter or leave, follow their paths, and count the number of individuals present.

        <h2>Face Mask Detection</h2>
        <video src="face_mask.mp4" controls muted></video>
        <p>
    This project uses deep learning and computer vision to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask properly, improperly, or not wearing one at all. 
    It works in real time on video streams from CCTV or cameras.

      <div class="project">
        <h2>Yoga Pose Detection</h2>
        <video src="yoga.mp4" controls muted></video>
         <p>
    This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect human postures in real time and classify them into specific yoga poses 
    such as Downward Dog, Warrior, Tree Pose, and more. The system provides instant feedback on correctness of posture and improvements needed.

        <h2>Vehicle Detection & Number Plate</h2>
        <video src="car.mp4" controls muted></video>
        <p>
    This project uses computer vision to detect multiple types of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks in real time. 
    After detection, the system extracts the number plate (license plate) and recognizes the characters, displaying them automatically.

      <div class="project">
        <h2>Emotion Fun Playlist</h2>
        <video src="emotions.mp4" controls muted></video>
       <p>
     I built a simple prototype that connects computer vision with personalized music.
The system detects a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù expression from an uploaded image
If happy is detected ‚Üí it shows a button that opens a matching Spotify playlist
(This can also be extended to live video feeds and more emotions)

        <h2>Emotion Detection</h2>
        <video src="emotion.mp4" controls muted></video>
       <p>
    
    I developed a system that can detect emotions such as:
Happy üôÇ
Sad üòî
Angry üò°
